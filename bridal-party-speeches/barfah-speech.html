'Two in perfect matrimony' (don't know if that's actually how it goes but you know what I mean. The bait traditional bit that the priest says. We've all heard that part some where some how) but yeah, these two peas in a pod are a "perfect" reference. Swodz is my youngest-elder female cousin and growing up around her she's always had the latest swag from early. It reaches a point where your swags so "turnt up" it goes through the roof... I used to think that was what they call over the top... Then I got wiser and realised narrh she's just unique, but when your so unique, Finding a 'perfect' match, or even just a match must be so difficult... I used to think it was impossible. Till one day, we were having one of many functions at my Aunties in Angell town, where the family always come to and Swodz asked me to go and meet one geezer from the bus stop.  Still young, I was anti geezers but it was Swodz so what could I say plus she'd never brought a geezer around Aunty Yvonne's so I went to grab the guy and yeah, it was Mr Jones (EJ) and two mates of his but I didn't pay the mates any mind, I was focused on EJ and just EJ, like I said I was abit anti to new comers but this guy, This guy! Swag on 150, hair on 125, This guy started chatting away like we had history, straight away, literally all the way to the function asking me bout the food and that... Anyway I Delivered him to Swodz and as soon as he got all the meet and greets over he was back with boys. The whole time i'm just scoping him from head to toe, secretly hating on the swag. Eventually Swodz came out to grab him, and I remember thinking they suit. I even think Swodz asked me and I gave him a good report not great but good, I was still reluctant to be too nice. . . . Life goes on as we know. 1 year past 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years 6 years this guy hasn't gone newhere , And as her swag evolved so did his or vice versa as his evolved so did hers. look at them. Perfect match and not just the swag, this is perfect matrimony. I wish you two all the best, whole heartedly I'm so happy for You two. So happy you made it to today. And I got faith that you two ain't going nowhere individually, I pray you move forward together, you were a match from the start, And I know Mr Jones loves you truss me Mrs Jones. In other words "perfect matrimony". It's all too perfect to be referred to as anything but that.

Love Joof<span class="lead"><i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></span>
